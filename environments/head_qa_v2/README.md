# HEAD-QA v2

Evaluation environment for the HEAD-QA v2 dataset.

### Overview
- **Environment ID**: `head-qa-v2`
- **Short description**: Single-turn medical multiple-choice QA 
- **Tags**: medical, single-turn, multiple-choice, eval

### Datasets
- **Primary dataset(s)**: HEAD-QA v2 (HF datasets)
- **Source links**: [alesi12/head_qa_v2](https://huggingface.co/datasets/alesi12/head_qa_v2) 
- **Split sizes**: Uses the provided train split for evaluation

### Task
- **Type**: Single-turn
- **Parser**: `JSONParser`
- **Rubric overview**: Binary scoring (1.0 / 0.0), based on correct answer
- **Reward function:** `accuracy` — returns 1.0 if the predicted answer matches, else 0.0.

### Quickstart
Run an evaluation with default settings:

```bash
uv run vf-eval head-qa-v2
```

### Usage
To run an evaluation using vf-eval with the OpenAI API:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
uv run vf-eval \
  -m gpt-4.1-mini \
  -n 5 \
  -s \
  head_qa_v2
```
Replace `OPENAI_API_KEY` with your actual API key.

    abstract = "We present HEAD-QA, a multi-choice question answering testbed to encourage research on complex reasoning. The questions come from exams to access a specialized position in the Spanish healthcare system, and are challenging even for highly specialized humans. We then consider monolingual (Spanish) and cross-lingual (to English) experiments with information retrieval and neural techniques. We show that: (i) HEAD-QA challenges current methods, and (ii) the results lag well behind human performance, demonstrating its usefulness as a benchmark for future work.",
