# MEDMCQA

Evaluation environment for the MEDMCQA dataset.

### Overview
- **Environment ID:** `med_mcqa`
- **Short description:** Single-turn medical multiple-choice QA
- **Tags:** medical, single-turn, multiple-choice, train, eval

### Datasets
- **Primary dataset(s):** MedMCQA (HF datasets)
- **Source links:** [lighteval/med_mcqa](https://huggingface.co/datasets/lighteval/med_mcqa)
- **Split sizes:** Uses provided train and validation splits

### Task
- **Type:** Single-turn
- **Parser:** `Parser` (standard) or `ThinkParser` (if using reasoning mode) depending on `use_think`
- **Rubric overview:** Binary scoring (1.0 / 0.0), based on correct letter or answer text match.  
- **Reward function:** `accuracy` — returns 1.0 if the predicted answer matches, else 0.0.

### Model Input Format
Each example is formatted as a single-turn user message: 

```
Give a letter answer among A, B, C or D.
Question: {question}
A. {opa}
B. {opb}
C. {opc}
D. {opd}
Answer:
```

The model should respond with a letter choice (A–D).

### Quickstart
Run an evaluation with default settings:

```bash
uv run vf-eval med_mcqa
```

### Usage
To run an evaluation using `vf-eval` with the OpenAI API:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
uv run vf-eval \
  -m gpt-4.1-mini \
  -n 5 \
  -s \
  med_mcqa
```
Replace `OPENAI_API_KEY` with your actual API key.

  abstract = 	 {This paper introduces MedMCQA, a new large-scale, Multiple-Choice Question Answering (MCQA) dataset designed to address real-world medical entrance exam questions. More than 194k high-quality AIIMS & NEET PG entrance exam MCQs covering 2.4k healthcare topics and 21 medical subjects are collected with an average token length of 12.77 and high topical diversity. Each sample contains a question, correct answer(s), and other options which requires a deeper language understanding as it tests the 10+ reasoning abilities of a model across a wide range of medical subjects & topics. A detailed explanation of the solution, along with the above information, is provided in this study.}
